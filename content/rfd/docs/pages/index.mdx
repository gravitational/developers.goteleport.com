## What

Request For Discussion (RFD) is a design document format for non-trivial
technical Teleport changes. It's also a process by which these documents are
proposed, discussed, approved and tracked.

## Why

As the Teleport project grows, we need a way to discuss major changes (e.g. new
features, major refactors, major distribution changes).

Prior to RFDs, Teleport engineers used several other discussion methods (Google
Docs, brainstorm meetings, internal wiki pages, ad-hoc email/chat
conversations).

RFDs formalize the process and provide several benefits:
- discussions are retained in GitHub pull requests and commit history
- discussions are in the open, for Teleport users to see and contribute
- discussions are stored in one central place
- approvals are recorded and enforced

The RFD idea is borrowed from https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/ which is in turn inspired by https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/

## Details

Each RFD is stored in a markdown file under https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/rfd and has a unique number.
